Starting a new file of learning notes because having them
electronically accessible is better than physical notes for the
purpose of quick searching.

Summary of yesterday:
I wanted to sort through the Covid page separate from the
page loading (because it slows down the initial app) so I created
a separate class for data logic with its own url. But that meant
that I needed to render a separate template for the method call
to happen. It also meant that that separate page had to be loaded
for the data to come through so I don't have access to it via
AJAX on template page (without the separate page load).
So I returned to initial organization of logic in
one Template class and will now have it call upon click.
