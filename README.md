A Rack-Only Learning Project App

The goal is to code a minimalist Ruby app that tracks Ontario Covid cases.

In theory, this app can:
- retrieve updated Covid data for Ontario
- render pie chart of cities (AMcharts)
- render heatmap on cities with active cases (GoogleMaps API)
- do all renderings asynchronously
